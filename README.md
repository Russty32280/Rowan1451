# Rowan IEEE 1451 Development
This repository holds the work being done by the Rowan University SMART Lab group towards the IEEE 1451 Family of Standards.

## Repository Organization
The following folders will be maintained in the repository:
* NCAP Server
* NCAP Client
* TIM
* TEDS
* Documentation


# Setting up your Development Environment
Each specific part of the project will list in its respective README the libraries needed; however, there are some overarching tools/environments that you will need.

## NCAP Server
Our NCAP Server development is done in *Python3* as the main language and is ran on a Raspberry Pi. We will be providing information on how to run the NCAPServer on a computer, but current development is focused on the Raspberry Pi Environment.

## NCAP Client
Coming Soon

## TIM
TIM development will range between multiple devices from the Raspberry Pi to the MSP430 to ESP32 or ESP8266. For each of these platforms the target languages/platforms are:
* *Raspberry Pi:* Python
* *MSP430:* C and Code Composer Studio
* *ESP32/8266:* Arduino IDE

## TEDS
Coming Soon
